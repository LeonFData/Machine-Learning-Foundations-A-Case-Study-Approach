# Machine Learning Foundations A Case Study Approach

This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations) provided a series of practical case-studies for me to learn and get hands-on experience with machine learning. At the end of the course I had studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images. Through hands-on practice with these use cases, I am able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.

### All assignments use iPython notebooks for an interactive experience.
