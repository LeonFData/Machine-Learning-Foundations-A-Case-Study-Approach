# Machine-Learning-Foundations-A-Case-Study-Approach
    Hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies

# learn a broad range of machine learning methods for deriving intelligence from data, and by the end of the course stdent will be able to implement actual intelligent applications. These applications will allow you to perform predictions, personalized recommendations and retrieval, and much more. If you continue with the subsequent courses in the Machine Learning specialization, you will delve deeper into the methods and algorithms, giving you the power to develop and deploy new machine learning services.

 These assignments---one per Module 2 through 6---will cover Python implementations of intelligent applications for:
    1. Predicting house prices
    2. Analyzing the sentiment of product reviews
    3. Retrieving Wikipedia articles
    4. Recommending songs
    5. Classifying images with deep learning
All assignments use iPython notebooks for an interactive experience.
